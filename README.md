Replication analysis for EWAS of infant sex in cord blood using the GEO dataset GSE129841

The R script accompanies the manuscript "Associations between infant sex and DNA methylation across umbilical cord blood, artery, and placenta samples" and provides code for replication analysis for EWAS of infant sex in cord blood using the GEO dataset GSE129841, including downloading GEO data, performing analysis of differentially methylated positinos, and performing analysis of differentially methylated regions.
